Division of labour:

We used an Extreme Programming software development framework for all production of code.
Karl was the primary coder for the entirety of the program.
Gautam and Thomas were contributors over screenshare software and over voice chat.

Our team agreed to meet at a consistent time on a weekly basis dedicated to developing the program so as to not
leave anybody out or leave anybody behind. 

The full solution directory was routinely synced to an Azure DevOps repo where all team members
had complete access to the files.

All members executed rigorous testing on their own time and reported all bugs found in a group chat.
